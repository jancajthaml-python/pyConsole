**Why does it even exists don't you know about curses, gosh....**
Yup, been there didn't like it major deal breaker was screen flickering and (for me) insufficient rendering performance

**Can you add {insert feature}**
A: Nope, this library focuses only on barebone bootstrap of terminal application, everything else should be done with composition and custom code
