Spoiler alert: Crude draft, pre-pre-pre-alpha

Q: Why does it even exists don't you know about curses, gosh....

A: Yup, been there didn't like it major deal breaker was screen flickering and (for me) insufficient rendering performance



Q: Can you add *insert feature*?

A: Nope, this library focuses only on barebone bootstrap of terminal application, everything else should be done with composition and custom code
